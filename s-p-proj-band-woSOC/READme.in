Prepare the input file as described above
! Input file description for orbital projected plots
1. Number of bands (bands calculation output file)
2. Number of total k-points(pbands.projwfc_up file last value of first column)
3. Fermi energy calculated (Found in SCF/NSCF output file
4. Number of high symmetric points (Nhsp)
5. High symmetric point(HPS) position starts and end at 5+Nhsp-1 line
6. Next two lines are for y_min and y_max
7. The next line is the Size of the points in the plot.

Now First run orb_proj_file.py which generates the separate band projection files.
Then run plot1.py file to get the orbital projected band plots.
